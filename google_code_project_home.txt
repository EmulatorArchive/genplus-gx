Genesis Plus GX - accurate & portable Sega 8/16 bit emulator

Genesis Plus GX is an open-source Sega 8/16 bit emulator focused on accuracy and portability. Initially ported and developped on Gamecube / Wii consoles only through libogc / devkitPPC (http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/), it is now available on many other platforms through various frontends.

The source code, originally based on Genesis Plus 1.2a by Charles MacDonald (http://www.techno-junk.org/), has been heavily modified & enhanced, with respect to initial goals and design, in order to improve the accuracy of emulation, implementing new features and adding support for extra peripherals, cartridge & systems hardware.

The result is that Genesis Plus GX is now more a continuation of the original project than a simple port, providing very accurate emulation and 100% compatibility with Genesis / Mega Drive, Sega/Mega CD, Master System, Game Gear & SG-1000 released software (including all unlicensed or pirate known dumps), also emulating backwards compatibility modes when available.

Multi-platform sourcecode (core) is maintained through SVN and GIT (https://github.com/ekeeke/Genesis-Plus-GX) so that other Genesis Plus ports can take advantage of it, as I sincerely hope this emulator can become a reference for open-source and accurate Genesis emulation. If you ported this emulator to other platforms or need help porting it, feel free to contact me.

Latest official Gamecube / Wii standalone port (screenshots below) is available here for download and comes with plenty of exciting features that have nothing to envy to your most favorite PC emulators and makes this emulator the most faithful experience for any Sega 8/16-bit fans.

You can grab the lastest compiled SVN binaries from here. Feel free to report any bugs on the Issue page.

Genesis Plus GX core is also being used in various multi-platform and/or multi-console emulation projects such as:

    Retroarch (http://www.libretro.com/)
    Bizhawk (http://tasvideos.org/Bizhawk.html)
    OpenEmu. (http://openemu.org/)

Please note that commercial applications like MD.emu, EmiGens, DroidGen or AndroGens available on mobile platforms are all rebranded ports that use an outdated version of Genesis Plus GX and that none of the profits made by these applications actually benefit to this project or his contributors. Therefore, they are not supported and it is recommended to use Retroarch (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.retroarch) instead.

If you like this project and simply want to show your appreciation, small Paypal donations are always welcomed.

You can also support further development by donating equipments such as additional controllers & debugging tools to improve port development, as well as console hardware (Model 1 Master System, Game Gear, Model 1 Genesis, Mega CD, CDX, 32x, etc) & development tools to allow me running test on real hardware and help improving emulation accuracy. Last but not least, I can help you dumping or adding support for undumped cartridges, do not hesitate to contact me.

Not liking how Classic Controller feels ? Looking for a wireless retro-adapter to use your old control pad with retro emulators ? Give this open-source project a look: http://www.brunofreitas.com/?q=node/35
