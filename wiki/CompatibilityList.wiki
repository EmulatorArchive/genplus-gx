Genesis Plus's compatibility should be quite high, let's say 99.9% of known roms are working without any graphical glitches or lockup. The only unsupported ones are a few unlicensed/pirates games which require some custom cartridge hardware currently unemulated. 


I personnaly tested many games to be sure they all work like on original hardware, however, it is impossible for me to test all games *from start to end* so feel free to add comments if you found a specific game not running properly with this emulator.


On a side note, make sure you are always using good dumps, ROM files labelled as bad dump (b1, b2,...) are generally known to cause problem (even on real hardware).
