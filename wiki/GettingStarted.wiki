== Choose a version ==

Gamecube and Wii applications generally come in the form of .dol files.

Once you have downloaded and decompressed the archive, you get two versions of the emulator:

 * genplus_cube.dol is the version running in Gamecube mode. This can be loaded on a Gamecube or on a Wii using Gamecube compatible mode.

 * genplus_wii.dol is the version running in Wii mode. This can only be loaded on a Wii and provide extra features such as support for up to 8players and wiimote 

  
  
== How to load the emulator ==

=== on the Wii ===

The easiest way to load & run the emulator on the Wii is to install the [http://hbc.hackmii.com/ Homebrew Channel].

Once you are done, simply copy the /apps directory and his content (included in the release) to the root of the SDCARD.

== How to use the emulator ==

This is a Sega Genesis/Megadrive emulator: it requires suitable ROM images in the form of .bin or .smd files but .zip files are also supported (as long as they contain a proper ROM file).

ROM files need to be loaded first: you can either load them from a DVD or from SDCARD. On the Gamecube, a modchip is required for DVD access and a SD-adapter is also required for SDCARD support.

=== from SDCARD ===

You should create a directory named */genplus* at the root of your SDCARD. Inside this directory, create a subdirectory named */roms* and place your roms inside that directory. You can create as many subdirectories as you want and reduce the number of roms per directory to improve loading times. Also note that if the /roms directory does not exist, the program will let you browse from the root of the SDCARD.

=== from DVD ===

The most important thing is that the DVD should be compliant with the ISO9660 format. Otherwise, ROM files can be put anywhere but again, it is better to use subdirectories and keep a limited amount of files in each directory.

Wii user will need to install the [http://hackmii.com/2008/08/libdi-and-the-dvdx-installer/ DI layer interface] first and burn a suitable DVD. Please read the above article carefully to know how to install properly the DVDX stub and the required type for DVD, especially if you have a modchip.

Also note that, thanks to DVDX, contrary to Gamecube users, a  modchip is not required to load from DVD.
