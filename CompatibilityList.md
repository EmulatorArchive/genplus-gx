Genesis Plus GX is able to accurately emulate various console hardware models, which makes it compatible with 100% of SG-1000, Master System, Game Gear, Genesis / Mega Drive  & Sega/Mega CD released software, including demos, unlicensed & pirate games.

This means that all these games have been verified to be working without any graphical glitches or lock-up but off course, it is impossible for me to test all games **from start to end** so feel free to report an issue if you found a specific game not running properly or accurately with this emulator.

On a side note, make sure you are always using good dumps: ROM files labeled as bad, "fixed" or hacked dumps (b1, f1, h1, ...), are known to cause issues, even on real hardware.

## SG-1000 games ##
