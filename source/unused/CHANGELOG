- completely rewrote EEPROM emulation: now support all known EEPROM types (24C01-24C65) and mappers (Sega, Acclaim, EA, Codemasters)
used in a few games (now use internal game database) as external RAM. This should at least fix save support in the following games:
  . NBA Jam (alternate Acclaim mapper)
  . College Slam, Frank Thomas Big Hurt Baseball (24C65 type)
  . NHLPA Hockey 93, Rings of Power (EA mapper)
  . Micro Machines serie, Brian Lara Cricket 96/Shane Warne Cricket (Codemasters mapper)

- modified WRITE_xxx & READ_xxx macros for better portability and faster memory access on BIG ENDIAN platform 
- completely rewrote BIG ENDIAN support in render.c and vdp.c: rendering should be a little faster

 [07/20/07] (Eke-Eke)

- added SVP faking: display 2D graphics in Virtua Racing (the game is however still unplayable)
- added support for more internal IO registers: fixe some unlicensed games (Wisdom Tree games...)
- added preliminary support for unmapped protection device: fix some unlicensed games with special built-in hardware (Squirell King, Lion King 2...)
- added "Soft Reset" combo (in game, use L+Z triggers): this should be like pressing the RESET button on a real Genesis and this is required
  in some games to enable special features or even complete the game (ex: X-Men).

 [06/21/07] (Eke-Eke)
- added Multitap support (EA 4-Way Play and Sega Teamplayer): allowed up to four players in games supporting those peripherals
- added partial Sega Menacer lightgun support (use Analog Stick): automatically set when detecting the 6-in-1 Menacer game

 [05/18/07] (Eke-Eke)
- you can now switch between FM cores without reseting the game. FM registers  value are automatically restored when switching.
- removed the previous VINT timings modification because it brokes some games (Rocket Knight, Thunderforce III,...)
- added automatic Timing configuration (VDP latency, VINT timing & alternate Line Timing) at game loading, based upon specific romname detection.
This means you can still modify some of these options afterwards but they are now automatically set/unset when loading a game which need
special timing fixes. These fixes are also automatically desactivated when the current game doesn't need them.
For information, games that are actually detected and need special timings to run properly are:
 .Legend of Galahad & Road Rash series (single line not rendered properly)
 .Sesame Street Counting Cafe (don't boot)
 .Chaos Engine/Soldiers of Fortune (graphic glitches on scrolling)

- corrected DAC output level (fixes voices and some special FX being too low)
- added support for Gens YM2612 (FM) core (MAME's one still remains default FM core)
- added configurable preamplification for each sound cores (see Emulator Options)
- added some other configurable sound options (boost overall volume, FM improvment for Gens YM2612)

- added sprite collision detection (fix Strider 2)
