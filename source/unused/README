 Usage
 -----

 The Windows version runs windowed in a 16-bit desktop with NO sound or
 joystick support.

 The DOS version has most of the functionality from SMS Plus, such
 as audio, joysticks, etc.

 Windows/DOS controls:

 Arrow Keys -   Directional pad
 A,S,D,F    -   1P gamepad, buttons A, B, C, Start
 Tab        -   Reset
 Esc        -   Exit program

 DOS only:

 End        -   Exit program
 F1-F4      -   Set frameskip level (F1 = no skip ... F4 = skip 3 frames)
 F8         -   Make PCX screen snapshot
 F9         -   Toggle VSync
 F10        -   Toggle speed throttling
 F11        -   Toggle FPS meter

 DOS details:

 You can only support a second player if you are using a joystick driver
 that supports more than one joystick. (e.g. Sidewinder, dual pads, etc.)

 Type 'gen -help' on the command line for a list of useful options.

    -res <x> <y>    set the display resolution.
    -vdriver <n>    specify video driver.
    -depth <n>      specify color depth. (8, 16)
    -scanlines      use scanlines effect.
    -scale          scale display to full resolution. (slow)
    -vsync          wait for vertical sync before blitting.
    -sound          enable sound. (force speed throttling)
    -sndrate <n>    specify sound rate. (8000, 11025, 22050, 44100)
    -sndcard <n>    specify sound card. (0-7)
    -swap           swap left and right stereo output.
    -joy <s>        specify joystick type.

 Here is a list of all the video drivers you can pass as a parameter
 to the '-vdriver' option:

    auto, safe, vga, modex, vesa2l, vesa3, vbeaf

 Here is a list of all the joystick drivers you can pass as a parameter
 to the '-joy' option:

    auto, none, standard, 2pads, 4button, 6button, 8button, fspro, wingex,
    sidewinder, gamepadpro, grip, grip4, sneslpt1, sneslpt2, sneslpt3,
    psxlpt1, psxlpt2, psxlpt3, n64lpt1, n64lpt2, n64lpt3, db9lpt1, db9lpt2,
    db9lpt3, tglpt1, tglpt2, tglpt3, wingwar, segaisa, segapci, segapci2

 You can put any commandline option into a plain text file which should
 be called "gen.cfg". Put one option per line, please. Command line options
 will override anything in the configuration file.

 Currently the zip loading code can manage a zipfile where the game
 image is the first thing in it. If you try to open a huge archive of
 games, only the first will be played.
